```bash
pnpm install
```

### 2. Set up environment variables
Copy `env.template` to `.env.local` and fill in your values:
```bash
cp env.template .env.local
```

Or create `.env.local` manually:
```env
BOT_TOKEN=your_telegram_bot_token_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL=https://your-deployed-app-url.vercel.app
CONVEX_DEPLOYMENT=your_convex_deployment_url
NODE_ENV=development
```

### 3. Get a Telegram Bot Token
1. Open Telegram and search for `@BotFather`
2. Send `/newbot` and follow the instructions
3. Copy the bot token to your `.env.local` file

### 4. Deploy your app
Deploy to Vercel, Netlify, or your preferred platform and update the `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_URL` in your environment variables.

### 5. Run the bot
```bash
pnpm bot
```

## Development

### Option 1: All in one terminal
```bash
pnpm dev:all
```

### Option 2: Separate terminals
**Terminal 1 - Next.js:**
```bash
pnpm dev
```

**Terminal 2 - Convex:**
```bash
pnpm convex dev
```

**Terminal 3 - Bot:**
```bash
pnpm bot
```

# Telegram Mini Apps Next.js Template

This template demonstrates how developers can implement a web application on the
Telegram Mini Apps platform using the following technologies and libraries:

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [TON Connect](https://docs.ton.org/develop/dapps/ton-connect/overview)
- [@telegram-apps SDK](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/packages/telegram-apps-sdk/2-x)
- [Telegram UI](https://github.com/Telegram-Mini-Apps/TelegramUI)

> The template was created using [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/). Therefore, it is
> required to use it for this project as well. Using other package managers, you
> will receive a corresponding error.

## Scripts

This project contains the following scripts:

- `dev`. Runs the application in development mode.
- `dev:https`. Runs the application in development mode using self-signed SSL
  certificate.
- `build`. Builds the application for production.
- `start`. Starts the Next.js server in production mode.
- `lint`. Runs [eslint](https://eslint.org/) to ensure the code quality meets
  the required
  standards.

To run a script, use the `pnpm run` command:

```Bash
pnpm run {script}
# Example: pnpm run build
```

## Create Bot and Mini App

Before you start, make sure you have already created a Telegram Bot. Here is
a [comprehensive guide](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/creating-new-app)
on how to do it.

## Run

Although Mini Apps are designed to be opened
within [Telegram applications](https://docs.telegram-mini-apps.com/platform/about#supported-applications),
you can still develop and test them outside of Telegram during the development
process.

To run the application in the development mode, use the `dev` script:

```bash
pnpm run dev
```

After this, you will see a similar message in your terminal:

```bash
▲ Next.js 14.2.3
- Local:        http://localhost:3000

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 2.9s
```

To view the application, you need to open the `Local`
link (`http://localhost:3000` in this example) in your browser.

It is important to note that some libraries in this template, such as
`@telegram-apps/sdk`, are not intended for use outside of Telegram.

Nevertheless, they appear to function properly. This is because the
`src/hooks/useTelegramMock.ts` file, which is imported in the application's
`Root` component, employs the `mockTelegramEnv` function to simulate the
Telegram environment. This trick convinces the application that it is
running in a Telegram-based environment. Therefore, be cautious not to use this
function in production mode unless you fully understand its implications.

### Run Inside Telegram

Although it is possible to run the application outside of Telegram, it is
recommended to develop it within Telegram for the most accurate representation
of its real-world functionality.

To run the application inside Telegram, [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather)
requires an HTTPS link.

This template already provides a solution.

To retrieve a link with the HTTPS protocol, consider using the `dev:https`
script:

```bash
$ pnpm run dev:https

▲ Next.js 14.2.3
- Local:        https://localhost:3000

✓ Starting...
✓ Ready in 2.4s
```

Visiting the `Local` link (`https://localhost:3000` in this example) in your
browser, you will see the following warning:

![SSL Warning](assets/ssl-warning.png)

This browser warning is normal and can be safely ignored as long as the site is
secure. Click the `Proceed to localhost (unsafe)` button to continue and view
the application.

Once the application is displayed correctly, submit the
link `https://127.0.0.1:3000` (`https://localhost:3000` is considered as invalid
by BotFather) as the Mini App link to [@BotFather](https://t.me/botfather).
Then, navigate to [https://web.telegram.org/k/](https://web.telegram.org/k/),
find your bot, and launch the Telegram Mini App. This approach provides the full
development experience.

## Deploy

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use
the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme)
from the creators of Next.js.

Check out
the [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/deployment) for
more details.
